                                    The 300-meter long tunnel was discovered by the landowners while excavating the area
                                    in
                                    preparation for a hotel’s construction. Passageways, rooms, armaments and other
                                    artifacts were discovered inside the tunnel. It was later confirmed that the tunnel
                                    was
                                    dug out by war prisoners by order of the Japanese Imperial Army during the Second
                                    World
                                    War.

                                    The items found inside the tunnel were evidence that it was used by Japanese
                                    soldiers to
                                    seek cover as they were chased by the American liberating army. The tunnel was also
                                    used
                                    as headquarters of the country’s erstwhile invaders, with small chambers used as
                                    offices
                                    and dungeons for prisoners. Vintage guns, explosives and other ammo were also found
                                    inside the tunnel, proof that it was also used as an armory.

                                    During the excavation, gold moulders were also found inside the tunnel. This fueled
                                    the
                                    rumor that the Imperial Army either stored their ever-elusive treasure inside or
                                    were
                                    digging for gold. No proof whatsoever was found to substantiate these claims but it
                                    definitely adds to the mystery of the place.
