                                    Every
                                    year, a large number of people visit for prayer and pilgrimage. The church has long
                                    served as the sanctuary of Santo Nino. The Augustinians were awarded possession of
                                    the
                                    nipa residence where the Santo Nino was discovered, as well as the surrounding

                                    on which they built the Philippines' first chapel. The current church was completed

                                    1739 after four renovations. By 1965, Pope Paul VI had renamed the church Basilica
                                    Minore. The church's front mixes Muslim, Romanesque, and neo-classical features in a
                                    traditional setting.

                                        <li>1735: Another devastating fire damaged the church. It was reconstructed once

                                    General Emilio Aguinaldo on December 1, 1898, which declared the country's

                                    from Spain..

                                    Philippines' east. It is located in the municipality of Palo in the province of
                                    Leyte.
                                    The national park is one of the world's smallest, with an area of about 0.026 square
                                    miles (0.067 square kilometers).
                                    The park is not in the conventional natural global national park category, but its
                                    cultural and historical importance merits it a position in the world's national park
                                    system. General Douglas MacArthur would arrive here on October 20, 1944, to begin

                                    liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese during World War II. This historic
                                    landing acted as the impetus for the most catastrophic naval engagement in World War
                                    II,
                                    with the most ships lost across all fleets. It was the war's largest naval fight.

                                    packed

                                    <h2>Miagao Church </h2> is located in the municipality of Miagao in the province of
                                    Iloilo and is one of the most visited sites in the region. This ancient church was
                                    built
                                    in 1786 and incorporates baroque design elements as well as themes of Chinese and
                                    Filipino components in its front, making it a unique place of worship and one of the
                                    Philippines' most stunning architectural gemstones.
                                    St. Christopher, for example, wears a traditional Filipino dress and is surrounded
                                    by
                                    decorations such as papaya and palm trees, which are very common in the country. The
                                    distinctive yellow-ochre color of the Miagao Church comes from the introduction of
                                    coral, ground into dust, and egg whites into the adobe mix. Spaniards typically use
                                    egg
                                    whites to make mortar for their churches, to make the mixture more robust. In
                                    recognition of its numerous architectural styles, it was eventually named a UNESCO
                                    World
                                    Heritage Site in December 1993.

                                            the supervision of Spanish friars. The church is built in response to
                                            frequent
                                            Moro raids and is designed as a fortress-like structure.

                                        <li>Early 18th Century: Construction of the church is completed around 1797. The
                                            church's unique architecture is a fusion of Baroque, Romanesque, and Gothic
